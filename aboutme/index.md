<p style="margin-top: 10px;">
I am <b>Zhang, Audrey J</b>, currently living in Hong Kong. I have a Masters degree in 'Computer Science' from The University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong), and
have been developing Artificial Intelligence software, business software applications (both for work) and fun stuff (pet projects and other stuff
for learning, etc) for more than 4 years.
<br/><br/>

I  have always been curious about many things.
I am fascinated by different cultures and like to travel, experience it and understand the world in a better way.
I want to use this website to capture/archive some of my work and to share that with others.
<br/><br/>
When I am not working, I am either reading up different stuff related to technology, make-up videos, novels, etc or traveling
or binge-watching TV shows.
